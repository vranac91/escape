# escape

Escape is a simple, short, console-based choose-your-adventure game. It is inspired by several sources that share the same concept:

- [Time Machine children's book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(novel_series))
- [Cube Escape mobile games](http://www.cubeescape.com/)
- ["Bandersnatch" episode of the "Black Mirror" TV show](https://www.netflix.com/hr/title/80988062)

It really is fairly short. To finish the game in all paths, you'll need around 10 minutes. This is more of a showcase app
than the real game.


I'd like to update the game with time with longer story, more storyline branches and a UI. Also, I'd like to convert it to Android app.

All in good time, eh? Enjoy!
